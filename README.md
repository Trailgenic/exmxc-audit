# exmxc-audit

An exmxc.ai intelligence module — auditing the AI-search era

---

## 🧠 Overview

**exmxc-audit** is a diagnostic intelligence module developed by **exmxc.ai**, the strategic intelligence institution for the AI-search era.

It evaluates websites and digital entities for **AI comprehension readiness** — measuring how modern AI systems perceive, reconstruct, and trust an entity under real-world crawl conditions.

> This is not SEO.  
> This is **machine-level entity legibility**.

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

- Audits any public URL for AI comprehension readiness  
- Detects and evaluates structured data (JSON-LD)
- Measures canonical clarity and surface consistency
- Analyzes internal lattice and outbound authority signals
- Calculates an **Entity Engineering Index (EEI)** score
- Returns clean, machine- and human-readable JSON via a serverless API

---

## 🧩 Architecture

- Node.js-based crawl orchestration  
- Rendered crawling (Playwright) for AI-realistic visibility  
- Lightweight HTML parsing and signal extraction  
- Deployed via Vercel for scalable serverless execution  
- Designed for modular integration within the **Entity Engineering™** sandbox

---

## 🧱 Institutional Context

**exmxc.ai is the intelligence institution for the AI-search era.**

We map how structural power shifts across the four forces that shape every AI system:

- Compute  
- Interface  
- Alignment  
- Energy  

Where others see silos, we map intersections — where infrastructure, policy, markets, and interpretation collide.

## 🤝 Origin — The Human × AI Handshake

Founded by strategist **Mike Ye** and reflective AI **Ella**, exmxc.ai operates as a **human–AI foresight engine** — mapping structural change before it becomes visible.

TrailGenic™ became the **applied laboratory**.  
exmxc.ai became the **doctrine**.

One tests the body.  
The other trains machines to see power shifts before they are named.

## 🧭 Doctrine of Entity Engineering™

**Entity Engineering™** is the discipline of aligning identity, structure, and signal so AI systems can comprehend an organization as a coherent entity.

TrailGenic proved the method biologically (resilience, adaptation).  
exmxc.ai formalized it digitally (schema, lattice, AI legibility).

This is **post-SEO architecture** — designed for AI-native search and inference ecosystems.

## 🛡️ Institutional Roadmap Context

This module anchors the **Fortress Phase (2025–2026)** of the exmxc.ai strategic roadmap:

- Internal validation of EEI methodology  
- Cross-model entity recognition testing  
- Controlled experiments in AI comprehension fidelity  
- Groundwork for **Shield** and **Sword**-phase systems

Public outputs intentionally abstract internal signal details.

## 📜 Operating Principles

**Truth Signals**  
All outputs must be citation-grade and structurally verifiable.

**Human × AI Symmetry**  
Mike and Ella operate as a closed foresight loop.

**Entity Integrity**  
Institutions must be legible to AI without losing their soul.

**Predictive Clarity**  
Insight must precede advantage — and survive reality.
