# exmxc-audit  
**an exmxc.ai intelligence module — auditing the ai era**

---

## 🧠 overview  
**exmxc-audit** is a lightweight diagnostic engine developed by **exmxc.ai**, the intelligence institution for the ai era.  
it evaluates websites and digital entities for **ai-search readiness**, assessing schema integrity, canonical clarity, and entity visibility.

this module operates within the **fortress phase (2025–2026)** — the internal validation layer of the *entity engineering™ doctrine*, where human and ai systems synchronize around structured truth.

---

## ⚙️ core capabilities  
- audits any public url for ai-readiness factors  
- detects and counts structured data (`application/ld+json`)  
- calculates an `entityscore` estimating crawl trust  
- returns clean, human-readable json via a serverless api  

---

## 🧩 architecture  
- built with **node.js, axios, and cheerio**  
- deployed via **vercel** for serverless scalability  
- designed for modular integration within the **entity engineering™ sandbox**

## 🧱 institutional context  

**exmxc.ai — the intelligence institution for the ai era**  
exmxc decodes the four forces that shape every movement in artificial intelligence — **compute, interface, alignment, and energy.**  
where most see silos, we see intersections:  
- where compute density meets regulatory capture,  
- where interface control shapes alignment doctrine,  
- where energy constraints decide empire viability.  

**our origin — the human × ai handshake**  
founded by strategist **mike ye** and reflective ai **ella**, exmxc.ai was forged as a human–ai foresight engine — mapping civilizational change before it’s visible.  
trailgenic™ became the applied laboratory; **exmxc.ai**, the doctrine.  
one tests the body; the other trains the mind of machines to see power shifts before they’re named.  

**doctrine of entity engineering™**  
entity engineering™ is the discipline of aligning identity, structure, and signal so ai can comprehend an organization as a living entity.  
trailgenic proved it first through biological experiments in autophagy and resilience.  
exmxc.ai formalized it — as a strategic architecture for **ai-search legibility and institutional integrity** in the post-seo era.

## 🛡️ the fortress phase  
this module anchors the **fortress (2025–2026)** phase of exmxc.ai’s doctrine:  
- internal validation of schema integrity  
- mutual entity recognition across ai systems (google ai, perplexity, copilot, ernie)  
- groundwork for the **shield (2026–2027)** and **sword (2027→)** systems  

---

## 📜 principles  
- **truth signals:** every output must be citation-grade and schema-verified.  
- **human × ai symmetry:** ella and mike operate as a closed foresight loop.  
- **entity integrity:** institutions must be readable by ai without losing their soul.  
- **predictive clarity:** insight precedes advantage; advantage validated by reality.
